<b><hr>
I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's and Master's degree focussed in Environmental Engineering from  <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a> which is to be completed in 2024. 
I am an experienced Associate with a demonstrated history of working in various socities in IIT Bombay.     
My tenacity, commitment, and honesty make me who I am.I enjoy working in a fast-paced atmosphere. I have a creative mind which helps me to see things from a different perspective.<br> 
I am a dedicated and responsible person. My teammates can rely on me for any kind of work.<br><br>

My favourite pastimes are dancing and hiking.I also indulge myself in various sports as basketball, cricket, football,chess and badminton. I love cooking and listening to songs.
<br><br>
Truly said by Audrey Hepburn- "As you grow older you realize that you have two hands one for helping yourself and one for helping others"<br>
 I believe that giving back to the community is more important. So, my ambition is to become a good individual, a good citizen who can work for society and the Nation. If I describe my ambition in 3 simple words, it would be "MAKE INDIA BETTER".
Besides excelling in my career,I want to work for my country, make it a superpower, make it safe for women and I want that my country should excel in every field possible. I want to work for my society. I don't want to limit myself to my field only and help the needy in every possible way. With my interest inclined towards science and technology, I want to convert my theoretical knowledge into practical ways and work for the community as an individual.
